/**
 * @wasla/driver-bot — the WASLA driver bot (السائق).
 *
 * A composition root: every channel behaviour lives in @wasla/bot-runtime, and the
 * thing specific to this process is *which* bot it serves — `"driver"` — which
 * decides which Mini App it opens (BOT_MINI_APP.driver) and which variables it
 * reads (DRIVER_BOT_*).
 *
 * Phase 05 · MR 5/6 adds the one thing a composition root *is* allowed to add: the
 * binding between this channel and the Driver Core
 * (docs/02-architecture/DRIVER_BOT_FLOWS.md). The behaviour it binds lives in
 * `flows.ts` (neutral, no Telegram) and `driver-core.ts` (the only importer of the
 * domain), so the channel layer still knows no domain and the domain still knows no
 * channel (ADR-007 rule 2).
 *
 * Why a separate deployable: each bot has its own Telegram token and its own
 * webhook secret, so they are separate processes with separate blast radii. Why
 * no logic here: three copies of one webhook handler would drift, and one copy
 * would eventually forget the secret check.
