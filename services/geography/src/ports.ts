/**
 * Ports (hexagonal boundaries) for the Geography domain.
 *
 * Use cases depend only on these interfaces. Concrete adapters live in
 * ./infrastructure (in-memory, for unit tests) and will be added in later
 * MRs (Drizzle/Postgres repository in MR 4, Fastify HTTP layer in MR 5).
 *
 * Locale policy (ADR-006): repository methods return each entity paired with
 * its full LocalizedName (all locales). The use-case layer applies the locale
 * fallback (resolveLocalizedName) so the in-memory and Drizzle adapters behave
 * identically — the fallback rule lives in the domain, not per-adapter.
