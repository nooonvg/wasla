/**
 * Place a store order (ADR-026 §2.1 · §2.3 · §3.1 · §3.3).
 *
 * The orchestration, and only the orchestration: resolve the store through
 * the marketplace boundary, take price snapshots, reserve the public id,
 * ask the DOMAIN to build the aggregate and its events, hand the whole
 * thing to the store as ONE write.
 *
 * ## Events are built in the domain, never here and never in HTTP
 *
 * `domain/events.ts` owns every envelope. If this file assembled payloads,
 * a second entry point (a relay, a CLI, a test harness) would assemble them
 * differently and the outbox would carry two dialects of the same event.
 * The rule from review 1/N holds: state changes through ANY path emit their
 * event, from one builder.
 *
 * ## Why the id is reserved BEFORE the aggregate is built
 *
 * `store_order.created` carries `public_id`. An adapter that generated the
 * id during the insert would force the event to be patched after the fact —
 * so the sequence is read first, and the domain builds rows and events that
 * agree by construction.
 *
 * ## What this use case deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not decide eligibility (the task starts `pending_eligibility`), it
 * does not touch payment (that mirror is external, §2.2), and it does not
 * retry the catalog: a dependency failure surfaces as
 * `DELIVERY_MARKETPLACE_UNAVAILABLE` and the caller decides. Even now that an
 * `Idempotency-Key` makes the CALLER's retry safe (review 7/N, §4.10), an
 * internal retry loop here would still be wrong: it would reuse the same key
 * and turn a transient dependency failure into a 409 instead of the honest
 * dependency error the caller must see.
 *
 * ## Where the idempotency key is checked — and why placement differs from cancel
 *
 * Placement passes the intent THROUGH to the write port, which resolves it
 * inside the one transaction that also writes the order
 * (`store-order-store.ts`). A replayed placement therefore still resolves the
 * store, still takes price snapshots, and still burns a sequence value before
 * the replay is detected — wasted work on a rare retry, and nothing worse: the
 * transaction rolls back and the stored first response is returned.
 *
 * Cancellation cannot rely on that alone and adds a read-side pre-check
 * (`idempotency-guard.ts`), because its retry hits a domain refusal first: the
 * order is already `cancelled` and `cancelled → cancelled` is not an edge. The
 * asymmetry is deliberate and it is the smaller evil — the alternative is a
 * pre-check on this path too, i.e. an extra round trip on every placement to
 * save work on retries that should be rare. Both paths keep the transactional
 * check, so the GUARANTEE is identical either way; only the wasted effort on a
 * retry differs.
