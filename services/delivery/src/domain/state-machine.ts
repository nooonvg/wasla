/**
 * The store-order & delivery-task state machines — the single source of what
 * may happen to each (ADR-026 §3).
 *
 * The tables below are written out EDGE BY EDGE on purpose (same decision as
 * ADR-010 decision 3). A derived rule ("terminal states are final") reads
 * nicely and fails silently on the one case it did not anticipate — the
 * impossible state this phase forbids is exactly that case. Hand-written rows
 * are the cheaper mistake.
 *
 * These tables must stay identical to the published tables in
 * ADR-026 §3 (the binding reference). `__tests__/state-machine.test.ts`
 * parses the ADR document and compares this table against it, row by row,
 * failing on any divergence in either direction — the same style of guard as
 * ORDER_ENGINE.md in the orders phase.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT enforce:
 *  - **the actor.** Each edge records the actor the lifecycle expects, but
 *    nothing here rejects a mismatch: this review has no authentication, so
 *    `actor_type` is an unverified claim. What IS enforced is the shape
 *    rule: `system` carries no actor ref, anyone else must carry one.
 *  - **which reason code belongs to which edge.** The table records a
 *    typical reason; membership in the closed catalog is enforced elsewhere.
 *
 * What this module DOES enforce beyond the raw graph:
 *  - `placed → confirmed` additionally requires paymentState = authorized
 *    (§2.2 — the composite transition, tested, not reviewed).
 *  - `handed_to_courier → delivered` and `arrived → delivered` additionally
 *    require a proof of delivery (§2.4).
