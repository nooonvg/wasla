/**
 * Store-order cancellation — the PURE decision (ADR-026 §3.1 · §3.3).
 *
 * Cancellation is the one command a customer may issue after placement, so
 * it is the one place where a permissive implementation quietly breaks the
 * published tables. This file answers a single question — "is `cancelled`
 * reachable from where this order and its task stand?" — by ASKING THE
 * TABLES (`state-machine.ts`), never by re-listing states in a condition.
 *
 * ## Customer policy vs the graph (§4.29)
 *
 * The graph edge `assigned → cancelled` exists for the CORE projection: CORE
 * closes a fulfillment by cancellation from any open status (dispatched
 * included), and MARKET must apply that decision. But RECEIVING CORE's
 * confirmed cancellation is NOT granting the customer the right to issue a
 * cancel command from `assigned` — the customer's last point ("آخرُ نقطةٍ
 * يملكُ فيها العميلُ قرارَهُ") is `ready_for_delivery`, unchanged. So this
 * decision applies an explicit CUSTOMER_CANCELLABLE_FROM list (the §3.1
 * customer edges) BEFORE the generic graph reachability: the edge serves
 * the projection, the policy serves the command.
 *
 * ## Two aggregates, two tables, one command
 *
 * The order's fulfillment edge (§3.1) and the task's edge (§3.3) are
 * independent: §3.1 publishes `draft|placed|confirmed|ready_for_delivery →
 * cancelled`, while §3.3 publishes `eligible|dispatch_requested|
 * driver_assigned → cancelled`. The intersection is NOT total, and the gap
 * is real, not a modelling slip we may paper over:
 *
 *  - A JUST-PLACED order has a task in `pending_eligibility`, and §3.3 has
 *    NO edge from there to `cancelled`. So the order becomes `cancelled`
 *    while its task stays `pending_eligibility`. We do NOT invent the edge:
 *    the tables are the contract and a silent extra edge in code is drift.
 *    The consequence — a cancelled order whose task is still waiting for an
 *    eligibility decision — is declared in ADR-026 §4.9-1, and the correct
 *    fix is a contract revision (either an edge, or an explicit rule that
 *    eligibility resolution must check the order first).
 *  - `picking` and `picked` have NO fulfillment cancel edge: once a store
 *    started picking, the customer path is refusal by the store, not
 *    cancellation by the customer. Those return
 *    `DELIVERY_CANCEL_NOT_ALLOWED` (409), which is an ANSWER, not a bug.
 *
 * ## Why a dedicated error code and not the generic transition error
 *
 * `DELIVERY_CANCEL_NOT_ALLOWED` exists in the catalog precisely so a client
 * can distinguish "you may not cancel THIS, now" from any other refused
 * transition. Re-using `DELIVERY_TRANSITION_NOT_ALLOWED` here would collapse
 * that distinction into a message string.
