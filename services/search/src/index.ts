/**
 * @wasla/search-service — WASLA Marketplace Search domain core, relay, and HTTP
 * boundary (Phase 12).
 *
 * Derived READ MODEL (ADR-025): the search index is a projection rebuilt from
 * consumed marketplace events, NOT a second source of truth. Visibility is
 * rebuilt from consumed state (ADR-016 decision 3) — never stored as a flag.
 * Bilingual (AR/EN) query normalization + explained rule-based ranking.
 *
 * Review 2/N — Relay Consumer: consumes `marketplace_outbox` events, projects
 * them into search-owned state tables, and builds/refreshes the searchable
 * index via the catalog read port (GET /products/{productId}). Idempotent,
 * retryable, with dead-letter + checkpoint + replay. End-to-end proof:
 * outbox event → relay → search read model → correct resulting state.
 *
 * Review 3/N — HTTP Boundary (ADR-025 §5): Fastify app exposing
 * `GET /search/products` + `GET /search/health`, injected `SearchProductsReadPort`,
 * request parsing/validation, domain→wire mapping, single error handler (503 as
 * the last resort, never 500). Unit-tested with a fake port; the real pg reader
 * (`SearchIndexReader`) is integration-tested. The relevance/load exit gate and
 * the `search-db-integration` CI job remain deferred (ADR-025 §4) — declared.
 *
 * Review 5/N — Truthful `total` and real readiness (RISK-0029 · RISK-0030):
 * `count(*) OVER ()` makes `total` exact beyond any candidate cap, the cap
 * becomes a declared ranking window that REFUSES deeper pages with
 * `SEARCH_PAGE_OUT_OF_RANGE` instead of serving a truncated set, and
 * `GET /search/ready` (`SearchIndexHealthPort` + `SearchIndexHealthProbe`)
 * answers readiness by touching the index while `/search/health` stays liveness.
