/**
 * The production HTTP adapter for `OrderIntakePort` (Phase 06 · MR 5/6).
 *
 * This is the line Phase 04 promised would be «one adapter swap»: it replaces
 * `UnavailableOrderIntake` in the composition root and nothing in the domain or
 * the use cases changes. It posts the published `OrderIntakeRequest` payload to
 * the order engine's `POST /orders/intake` (port 8087) and returns the engine's
 * own reference — this service still never mints `order_public_id`.
 *
 * It replaces the gate-owned `HttpStubOrderIntake` in `@wasla/customer-e2e`,
 * which was explicitly marked «must not become the production adapter». The
 * difference is not the fetch call, it is the status map: the gate's adapter
 * spoke to a stub with three moods, while the real engine publishes five answers
 * and each one means something different for the customer's row.
 *
 * ## Status map (the whole point of this file)
 *
 * The engine's contract documents the meaning of each answer, so this adapter
 * does not get to invent one:
 *
 *   201 → accepted, a new order exists.
 *   200 → same `Idempotency-Key`, same payload: the order already exists and the
 *         engine is replaying its reference. **This is a success, not a
 *         conflict** — treating it as a failure would flip a stored `submitted`
 *         row back to `submission_failed` on a harmless retry.
 *   409 → same key, *different* payload. Retrying cannot ever succeed, so it is
 *         recorded as a final refusal (`REJECTED`) rather than as a retryable
 *         outage: leaving it retryable would busy-loop a request that the engine
 *         will refuse identically forever. That it is *our* mistake is stated in
 *         the message and the log, not smuggled into the customer's code.
 *   422 → understood and refused on business grounds (`REJECTED`).
 *   400 / 415 / 404 / any other 4xx → the engine could not read what we sent, or
 *         we called a path it does not publish. That is a defect on this side,
 *         **not** a business refusal: it is reported as `UNAVAILABLE` so the row
 *         is fail-closed and the alert lands on us. Dressing it up as
 *         «rejected» would tell the customer their order was refused when in
 *         fact it was never understood.
 *   503 / 5xx / connection refused → `UNAVAILABLE`, retryable **with the same
 *         key** (the engine de-duplicates, so a retry cannot create a twin).
 *   no answer within the timeout → `TIMEOUT`, which is the one case where the
 *         order may or may not exist; it stays distinct from `UNAVAILABLE`
 *         precisely because whoever operates the system must be able to tell
 *         «never landed» from «unknown».
 *
 * Every one of those becomes `OrderIntakeFailure` with a reason code, never a
 * partial result: `attemptHandover` in the use case turns it into a
 * `submission_failed` row plus a failure event, and the customer sees a single
 * 503 (`CUSTOMER_ORDER_INTAKE_UNAVAILABLE`). The finer reason is for operating
 * the system, not for the customer (ADR-009 §3).
 *
 * ## Correlation
 *
 * The customer's `Idempotency-Key` is forwarded as-is — it is the customer's
 * key, not a second one invented here, which is what makes a retry of the same
 * button press land on the same order. Both services bound the key to 8–128
 * characters, so a key this service accepted cannot be rejected by the engine
 * for length. `x-request-id` is forwarded too, so one trace id spans the
 * customer's request, the engine's audit row and both event envelopes.
 *
 * ## What this adapter deliberately does not do
 *
 * - **No retry loop.** The engine is idempotent, so a retry is safe, but *when*
 *   to retry is a decision about the customer's experience (and about queueing),
 *   and `POST /me/order-requests` already retries a `submission_failed` row on
 *   the next attempt with the same key. A hidden retry here would multiply the
 *   customer's timeout by the retry count.
 * - **No reading of orders.** `OrderIntakePort` has one method on purpose: this
 *   service does not own the order lifecycle (ADR-009 §3).
 * - **No auth header.** Phase 06 has no service-to-service authentication; when
 *   it arrives it belongs here as an option, and its absence is recorded in
 *   ORDER_HTTP.md rather than faked with a placeholder token.
