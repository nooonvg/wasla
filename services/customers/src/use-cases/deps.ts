/**
 * Shared dependencies injected into Customer Core use cases (hexagonal wiring).
 *
 * Tests inject the in-memory adapters; the HTTP bootstrap (MR 4/6) wires the
 * Postgres repository (MR 3/6) and, from Phase 06, the real order-engine
 * adapter. `orderIntake` is deliberately required: a build with no adapter must
 * be impossible, and the fail-closed default (`UnavailableOrderIntake`) has to
 * be chosen explicitly rather than happen by omission.
