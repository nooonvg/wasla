/**
 * Customer Core error contract.
 *
 * The catalog itself is NOT redefined here: the stable codes, their classes and
 * the HTTP status derived from each class live in @wasla/contracts-customer,
 * which is drift-guarded against services/customers/contracts/errors.md. This
 * file only wraps them in a throwable typed error, so a use case raises a
 * contract code and the HTTP layer (MR 4/6) maps it without re-classifying.
 *
 * Tests assert `code` — never the Arabic message copy.
