# gov-cases-state-sync.sh — mutation cases for checks 26 and 27 (STATE-SYNC · M0-52 · ADR-061).
#
# Sourced by scripts/checks/test-governance.sh. Uses its PASS/FAIL counters and $REPO_ROOT.
# Every case builds a fresh synthetic git repository in mktemp. The real guard and map are copied
# in; nothing touches the working repository. Each case states the verdict it expects and also the
# reason line that must produce it, so a BLOCK for the wrong reason fails the case. Each mutation
# proves it changed the file it claims to change.
#
# Required by the Program Owner decision (2026-10-04):
#   A code + state → PASS · B code without state → BLOCK · C security fix without risk sync → BLOCK
#   D valid docs-only → PASS · E docs that do not reflect the change → BLOCK
#   F merged PR whose branch remains → failure signal
# Rule: docs/00-rules/STATE_SYNC_RULE.md
