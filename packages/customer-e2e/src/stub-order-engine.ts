/**
 * The stub order engine — a real HTTP service that is not a real engine.
 *
 * Phase 04 hands over an order intent and stops there: matching, the order state
 * machine and `order_public_id` belong to Phase 06 (ADR-009 §3, and the
 * `OrderIntakeRequest` schema in the service contract says so in as many words).
 * The exit gate still has to answer «does a valid order **reach** the engine»,
 * and answering it against an in-process function would prove almost nothing:
 * the payload would never be serialised, so a camelCase leak or a float price
 * would pass unnoticed.
 *
 * So this stub is a real listener that behaves like a strict engine:
 *
 *   - it validates the body against the published `OrderIntakeRequest` shape and
 *     answers 400 when a required field is missing or of the wrong type — the
 *     gate wants a *reader* of the contract, not a recorder that accepts
 *     anything;
 *   - it mints `order_public_id` itself, because the engine owns that id;
 *   - it records every request it received, so the gate can assert the handover
 *     payload rather than the fact that a call happened;
 *   - it can be told to reject, to hang, or to fail — the fail-closed paths are
 *     part of the gate, not an afterthought.
 *
 * It lives in the gate package on purpose. Putting it under `services/` would
 * create a deployable that looks like an engine, and someone would eventually
 * wire it into an environment. `node:http` rather than Fastify: a stub with its
 * own framework dependency is a stub that can break for reasons of its own.
