/**
 * A gate-owned HTTP adapter for `OrderIntakePort`.
 *
 * **This is not the production adapter, and it must not become one.** Since
 * Phase 06 · MR 5/6 the production one exists — `HttpOrderIntakePort` in
 * `services/customers/src/infrastructure/http-order-intake.ts` — and it is what
 * the Phase 06 exit gate drives against the real engine. This adapter stays here
 * unchanged because the Phase 04 gate is a *frozen* proof about Phase 04: if it
 * started importing the production adapter, a later change to the engine's status
 * map would silently rewrite what Phase 04 was signed off on.
 *
 * The `OrderIntakeRequest` schema in `services/customers/contracts/api.openapi.yml`
 * assigns that work to Phase 06, which owns the engine and therefore owns its
 * URL, its auth and its retry policy. What Phase 04 owes is narrower: proof that
 * a validated intent leaves this service **as the published payload** and that
 * every refusal path is fail-closed. That needs an adapter, so the gate brings
 * its own — minimal, and living in a package that has no deployable.
 *
 * It uses the service's own `toOrderIntakeRequestDto`, which is the point: if the
 * gate wrote its own mapping, it would be asserting the gate's idea of the
 * handover rather than the service's.
 *
 * The three failure reasons are distinguished because the row and the failure
 * event carry them for whoever operates the system (ADR-009 §3):
 *
 *   422           → CUSTOMER_ORDER_INTAKE_REJECTED  (understood and refused)
 *   abort/timeout → CUSTOMER_ORDER_INTAKE_TIMEOUT   (no answer in time)
 *   anything else → CUSTOMER_ORDER_INTAKE_UNAVAILABLE (unreachable or broken)
 *
 * A 400 from the engine is *not* mapped to «rejected»: it means this adapter sent
 * something the engine could not read, which is a bug on our side, so it is
 * reported as unavailable rather than dressed up as a business refusal.
