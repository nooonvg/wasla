/**
 * Shared setup for the Phase 08 Exit Gate suite.
 *
 * The gate asks one question, and it is the one ROADMAP §3 wrote for this phase:
 * **«can a customer and a driver negotiate a price across four independent services
 * over real HTTP, agree on it, and have the ORDER ENGINE end up holding that number —
 * and does the agreement survive when the engine does not?»**
 *
 * Everything in the path is real, and that is the point of a gate:
 *
 *   - **identity** and **geography** are their own listeners, so the Customer Core's
 *     `HttpIdentityLookupPort` / `HttpGeographyPort` and matching's own
 *     `HttpZoneHierarchy` all speak HTTP exactly as deployed;
 *   - the **Customer Core** hands the intent to the **Order Engine** through the
 *     production `HttpOrderIntakePort`, so the order this suite negotiates over was
 *     created the way a customer creates one — with `price_mode: "negotiable"`, which
 *     is the only shape this phase is about;
 *   - **matching** and **dispatch** are their own listeners, and dispatch reaches
 *     matching and the engine through the production `HttpMatchingPort` and
 *     `HttpOrderEnginePort`. The dispatch OFFER a thread is opened on is therefore a
 *     real offer produced by a real wave, not an id this suite invented;
 *   - **negotiations** is its own listener behind `createNegotiationApp`, and its two
 *     outbound ports come from `configuredDispatchOffers` / `configuredAgreedPrice` in
 *     `@wasla/negotiations-service` — **the same functions `src/http/server.ts` calls**,
 *     given the same environment shape. That is deliberate and it is the whole reason
 *     `infrastructure/outbound-wiring.ts` exists as a module instead of two lines in the
 *     server (see its header): a gate that wired its own adapters would prove a
 *     composition nobody deploys.
 *
 * Why the composition lives here at all, given HANDOFF §14 item 2 says «`server.ts` is
 * the only permitted composition»: `services/negotiations/src/http/server.ts` ends in
 * `await main()` and is deliberately absent from the package's exports, so importing it
 * would raise a server on port 8091 and read `process.env`. The rule's intent — never
 * exercise a copy of a production adapter — is satisfied the way the four earlier gates
 * satisfy it: every adapter and every wiring decision is imported from the service, and
 * this file chooses nothing the service would choose differently. What it adds is what a
 * process cannot: ephemeral ports, an injected clock, and an order engine that can be
 * stopped and started again.
 *
 * Time is injected, never slept. One `GateClock` is shared by matching, dispatch AND
 * negotiations, so a round's deadline, an offer's deadline and a hand-off's retry moment
 * are all read off the same instant. Every deadline in this suite is crossed by moving
 * that clock and calling `POST /dispatch/tick` or `POST /negotiations/tick` explicitly: a
 * gate that waited on wall time would be slow when it passes and flaky when it fails.
 *
 * What is NOT real, declared rather than hidden:
 *
 *   1. **No driver service.** Phase 05 shipped and `packages/driver-e2e` drives it; here
 *      candidacy is seeded through matching's own `PUT /candidacy/{driver_public_id}`
 *      with `eligibility_source: "claimed"`, which is matching's declared contract for
 *      any caller that is not driver core (ADR-011). The reasoning is the one written in
 *      `packages/dispatch-e2e/src/harness.ts`: a gate that cannot fail alone can no
 *      longer say which phase regressed, and nothing in Phase 08 reads eligibility.
 *   2. **No bot and no channel.** A party negotiates by calling the negotiation routes —
 *      the same routes the two bots call in MR 5/6.
 *   3. **The identity, geography, customer, matching and dispatch stores are in-memory,
 *      always.** Each of those has its own gate for its own atomicity.
 *      `NEGOTIATION_DATABASE_URL` lifts **negotiations** onto Postgres, because the
 *      negotiation store is what this phase owns. Why not `DATABASE_URL`: that is the
 *      channel store (Phase 03) and the name negotiations' own integration job already
 *      uses; a separate name keeps this gate's database its own, so a failure here is
 *      never a collision with another job's schema.
 *   4. **The order engine store is in-memory too — and here it is load-bearing.** The
 *      fourth scenario stops the engine and starts it again on the same port, and it
 *      must come back holding the same orders. In-memory stores that outlive the
 *      listener are what make that possible without a database.
 *
 * Reasoning in docs/12-testing/PHASE08_EXIT_GATE_E2E.md.
