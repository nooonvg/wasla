/**
 * Shared setup for the Phase 05 Exit Gate suite.
 *
 * The gate asks one question: **«can a driver register, be reviewed, become eligible
 * by a CALCULATED verdict, receive a real offer from dispatch, and then — with one
 * pulse and no waiting — fall out of the pool the moment his document expires, with
 * matching reading `eligibility_source = driver_core` and never `claimed`?»**
 *
 * Everything in the path is real, and that is the point of a gate:
 *
 *   - **identity** mints the driver's `wasla_public_id`, over HTTP, the way the driver
 *     bot obtains it. A gate that invented `WS-1000000001` itself would be proving its
 *     own string format;
 *   - **geography** is its own listener, so the Driver Core's `HttpZoneCatalogPort`
 *     really asks `GET /geo/zones/{id}` before accepting a served zone. This is the
 *     only way the gate can claim the zone check is a check and not a formality: the
 *     unknown-zone scenario is refused by a service that was asked, not by a seeded set;
 *   - **matching** is its own listener, and the Driver Core reaches it through the
 *     **production** `HttpCandidacyPort` imported from `@wasla/drivers-service` — not a
 *     copy. This is the seam MR 5/6 could only prove against injected answers; here the
 *     wire itself is under test, including the key allowlist on matching's side, its
 *     `200`-not-`201` upsert, and the `driver_core` value in its `eligibility_source`
 *     enum;
 *   - the **Customer Core** hands a real intent to the **Order Engine** through the
 *     production `HttpOrderIntakePort` (Phase 06's gate), so the order this suite
 *     dispatches was created the way a customer creates one, not injected;
 *   - **dispatch** is its own listener and reaches matching and the engine through the
 *     production `HttpMatchingPort` and `HttpOrderEnginePort` (Phase 07's gate). The
 *     offer the driver receives is therefore an offer the shipped loop produced.
 *
 * That is seven listeners. None of them is a stub, and none of the four cross-service
 * adapters in the path is a copy — a gate that drove copies would keep passing while
 * the shipped adapters drifted, which is precisely the failure a gate exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## The promise this file keeps
 *
 * `packages/dispatch-e2e/src/harness.ts` says, in its header: *«No driver service.
 * Phase 05 (Driver Core) is not built. Candidacy rows are seeded through matching's own
 * `PUT /candidacy/{driver_public_id}` with `eligibility_source: "claimed"` … When Phase
 * 05 ships, the seeding helper here is the one place that changes, and
 * `eligibility_source` becomes `driver_core`.»*
 *
 * Phase 05 has shipped, and this file is where that promise is kept — but NOT by
 * editing Phase 07's harness. Phase 07's gate owns the question «does the dispatch loop
 * work?», and its four scenarios must stay able to put a driver in any state matching
 * accepts, including states the Driver Core would refuse to publish (a stale row, a
 * `busy` row, a driver serving a zone he has no vehicle for). Making that suite go
 * through the Driver Core would couple two gates: a Driver Core bug would then fail the
 * dispatch gate, and the failure would be reported against the wrong phase.
 *
 * So the promise is kept where it belongs: **here**, in the phase that owns the driver.
 * `eligibility_source` in this suite is `driver_core` because nobody typed it — the
 * Driver Core computed the verdict and published it. `dispatch-e2e` keeps `claimed`,
 * and that is now a deliberate statement rather than a gap: it is testing what matching
 * does with a row it was TOLD about, which is a case that still exists in production
 * (ADR-011) and needs a suite of its own.
 *
 * ## Time is injected, never slept
 *
 * One `GateClock` is shared by the Driver Core, matching and dispatch, so
 * `evaluated_at` (stamped by dispatch), `updated_at` (written by matching) and the
 * expiry instant (computed by the Driver Core) are all read off the same instant.
 * The document expiry in this suite is crossed by moving that clock and calling
 * `POST /drivers/eligibility/tick` exactly once: a gate that waited on wall time
 * would be a gate that is slow when it passes and flaky when it fails — and a
 * licence that expires in 2027 would make it unrunnable.
 *
 * ## What is NOT real, declared rather than hidden
 *
 *   1. **No driver bot and no channel.** Phase 03's gate owns the bots. A driver here
 *      registers and declares availability by calling the same routes the bot calls
 *      in-process (`bots/driver-bot`), so the routes are proven and the Telegram
 *      transport is not re-proven.
 *   2. **No document storage.** `storage_ref` is an opaque string by contract until
 *      Phase 12; the reviewer's decision is what eligibility depends on, and that is
 *      real here.
 *   3. **The customer store, the engine store, matching and dispatch are in-memory,
 *      always.** Phase 04, 06 and 07's gates own their atomicity. Repeating any of
 *      them here would make this gate fail for reasons that have nothing to do with
 *      the Driver Core. `DRIVER_DATABASE_URL` lifts **the Driver Core only**, because
 *      its atomicity is what this phase owns.
 *
 * Why `DRIVER_DATABASE_URL` and not `DATABASE_URL`: `DATABASE_URL` is the name the
 * Driver Core's own integration job already uses (`drivers-db-integration`), and the
 * channel store (Phase 03) uses it too. A separate name keeps this gate's database its
 * own, so a failure here is never a collision with another job's schema.
 *
 * Reasoning in docs/12-testing/PHASE05_EXIT_GATE_E2E.md.
